<h3><NAV><FONT SIZE="5PX">
Requirements for Windows. Google Chrome will run on computers equipped with a Pentium 4 processor or higher, 
which encompasses most machines manufactured since 2001. The computer must have approximately 100MB of free hard 
drive space and 128MB of RAM.
</h3>
<p><b>If you love Chrome, you can install Chromium from your Linux distribution's software repositories. 
The Chromium source code that Chrome is based on will continue supporting 32-bit Linux systems, so it will 
continue receiving updates. It's almost the same, and it even includes support for syncing your Google account.
