<h1><b><u><center>What's the latest version of Chrome?</center></u></b></h1>
<h2>There are several slightly different versions of Google Chrome - the latest version depends on which platform you are using.
</h2>

<h3>
<h2>Chrome OS</h2>  <NAV><FONT SIZE="5PX">
Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from 
Google's manufacturing partners. The user interface has a minimalist design resembling the Google Chrome 
browser. Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer time on the Web; the only applications on 
the devices are a browser incorporating a media player and a file manager.
Google announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009.
<h2>iOS</h2>
Chrome is available on Apple's mobile iOS operating system as Google Chrome for iOS. Released in the Apple 
App Store on June 26, 2012, it supports the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, and requires that the device has iOS 
10.0 or greater installed. In accordance with Apple's requirements for browsers released through their App
Store, this version of Chrome uses the iOS WebKit – which is Apple's own mobile rendering engine and components, 
developed for their Safari browser – therefore it is restricted from using Google's own V8 JavaScript engine.[232][233] Chrome is the default web browser for the iOS Gmail application, but it cannot be used as the device-wide default application for opening webpages because Apple has not provided iOS users with the option to change the default from Safari.[234]
In a review by Chitika, Chrome was noted as having 1.5% of the iOS web browser market as of July 18, 2012.
 In October 2013, Chrome had 3% of the iOS browser market
<h2>Linux</h2>
On Linux distributions, support for 32-bit Intel processors ended in March 2016 although Chromium is still 
supported. As of Chrome version 26, Linux installations of the browser may be updated only on systems that 
support GCC v4.6 and GTK v2.24 or later. Thus deprecated systems include (for example) Debian 6's 2.20, and RHEL
 6's 2.18.
Chrome on Linux	72.0.3626.121

<h2>Windows</h2>

Support for Google Chrome on Windows XP and Windows Vista ended in April 2016. The last release of 
Google Chrome that can be run on Windows XP and Windows Vista was version 49.0.2623.112,[240] released on April
 7, 2016, then re-released on April 11, 2016.
"Windows 8 mode" was introduced in 2012 and has since been discontinued. It was provided to developer channel,
 which enabled Windows 8 and 8.1 users to run Chrome with a full-screen, tablet-optimized interface, with access 
to snapping, sharing, and search functionalities.[243] In October 2013, Windows 8 mode on developer channel 
changed to use a desktop environment mimicking the interface of Chrome OS with a dedicated windowing system and 
taskbar for web apps. This was discontinued as of version 49 and users that have upgraded to Windows 10 will 
lose this feature.


<h2>macOS</h2>
Google dropped support for Mac OS X 10.5 with the release of Chrome 22. Support for 32-bit versions of 
Chrome ended in October 2014 with the release of Chrome 39.Support for Mac OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 
10.8 ended in April 2016 with the release of Chrome 50. Support for OS X 10.9 ended in April 2018 with the release
 of Chrome 66.
