Google Chrome (commonly known simply as Chrome) is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. 
It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. 
The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web apps.

Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's open-source Chromium project, but Chrome is 
licensed as proprietary freeware. WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked 
it to create the Blink engine; all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.
As of February 2019, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 62% worldwide browser market share across all
 platforms. Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome" brand name to other products: Chrome 
OS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and Chromebase.
