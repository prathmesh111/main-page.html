<b>usability and accessibility:</b>
<dd><p>Usability and accessibility It is possible to control some aspects of the browser using the keyboard shortcuts. Page zooming allows text, images and other content such as Adobe Flash Player, Java platform and Scalable Vector Graphics to be increased or decreased in size to help those with impaired vision. Opera Software claims that when the Opera Turbo mode is enabled, the compression servers compress requested web pages (except HTTPS pages) by up to 50%, depending upon the content, before sending them to the users.</dd> 
<dd><p>This process reduces the amount of data transferred and is particularly useful for crowded or slow network connections, making web pages load faster or when there are costs dependent for the total amount of data usage.This technique is also used in Opera Mini for mobile devices  and smartwatches. Privacy and security See also: Browser security One security feature is the option to delete private data, such as HTTP cookies, browsing history, items in cache and passwords with the click of a button.</dd>
<dd><p>This lets users erase personal data after browsing from a shared computer. When visiting a site, Opera displays a security badge in the address bar which shows details about the website, including security certificates. Opera also implements the Google Safe Browsing API to check the website that is being visited against blacklists for phishing and malware, and displays a warning page if it matches any of these lists.24 January 2007, Asa Dotzler of the competing Mozilla Corporation accused Opera Software of downplaying information about security vulnerabilities in Opera, (which were fixed in December 2006). Dotzler claimed that users were not clearly informed of security vulnerabilities that were present in the previous version of Opera, and thus they would not realize that they needed to upgrade to the latest version or else risk being exploited by hackers. Opera Software responded to these accusations on the next day.In 2016, a free virtual private network (VPN) service was implemented in the browser. Opera said that this would allow encrypted access to websites otherwise blocked, and provide security on public WiFi networks. Either VPN or Turbo can be enabled, but not both. Crypto Wallet Support In 2018, a built-in cryptocurrency wallet to the Opera Web Browser was released. Announcing that they would be the first browser with a built-in Crypto Wallet.</dd>
<dd><p> On December 13, 2018 they released a video showing many decentralized applications like Cryptokitties running on the android version of the Opera Web Browser[55]. Standards support Opera was one of the first browsers to support Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).[56] Development stages Opera Software uses a release cycle consisting of three "streams" (which correspond to phases of development) that can be downloaded and installed independently of each other: "developer", "beta" and "stable". New features are first introduced in the developer build, then, depending on user feedback, may progress to the beta version and eventually be released. The developer stream allows early testing of new features, mainly targeting developers, extension creators, and early adopters. Opera developer is not intended for everyday browsing as it is unstable and is prone to failure or crashing, but it enables advanced users to try out new features that are still under development, without affecting their normal installation of the browser. New versions of the browser are released frequently, generally a few times a week.The beta stream, formerly known as "Opera Next", is a feature complete package, allowing stability and quality to mature before the final release. A new version is released every couple of weeks. Both streams can be installed alongside the official release without interference. Each has a different icon to help the user distinguish between the variants.</dd>
