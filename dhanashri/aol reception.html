<b>Reception:</b>
<dd><p>AOL Explorer received a 4 out of 5 from PC Magazine in 2005, which said, "Even Firefox devotees should consider taking AOL's spiffy, feature-packed browser for a spin. However, the same article also contained some criticisms: "Questionable anti-spyware tools. Some features not yet working. Can't import favorites from Mozilla Firefox or Opera. Doesn't support Internet Explorer toolbars.</dd>
