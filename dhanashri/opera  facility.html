<dd><p>Opera 4.0, released in 2000,[8] included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms.[Opera (web browser) Opera is a web browser for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems developed by Norwegian company Opera Software AS. It is a Chromium-based browser using the Blink layout engine. Opera differentiates itself with a distinct user interface and other features. Opera was conceived at Telenor as a research project in 1994 and was bought by Opera Software in 1995.</dd>
<dd><p> It was commercial software for the first ten years and had its own proprietary Presto layout engine. The Presto versions of Opera received many awards, but Presto development ended after the big transition to Chromium in 2013. There are also three mobile versions called Opera Mobile, Opera Touch and Opera Mini. History Håkon Wium Lie, chief technical officer of the Opera Software company and co-creator of the CSS web standard Opera began in 1994 as a research project at Telenor, the largest Norwegian telecommunications company. In 1995, it branched out into a separate company named Opera Software.</dd>
<dd><p> Opera was first released publicly in 1996 with version 2.10, which only ran on Microsoft Windows. In an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected handheld devices, a project to port Opera to mobile device platforms was started in 1998.Opera 4.0, released in 2000,included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms. Up to this point, Opera was trialware and had to be purchased after the trial period ended. Version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of this requirement. Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users who had not paid for it. Later versions of Opera gave the user the choice of seeing banner ads or targeted text advertisements from Google. With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support for the browser came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).</dd>
