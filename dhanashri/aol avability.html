<b>Availability:</b>
<dd><p>Currently, AOL Explorer is available as an independent download or packaged with AIM Triton. When the browser starts up for the first time, it asks whether or not you would like to use it as the default browser and encourages users to display AIM Today content, if installed with AIM. Both of these are optional and can be denied.</dd>

<dd><p>AOL Explorer 1.5 was the last recorded version of AOL Explorer. The browser, even though it can still be downloaded, was succeeded by AOL OpenRide, which in turn was succeeded by AOL Desktop.</dd>
