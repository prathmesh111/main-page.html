<b><u>How Chrome handles your information.<p></b></u>
<p>Information for website operators. Sites that you visit using Chrome will automatically receive standard log information, including your system’s IP address and data from cookies. In general, the fact that you use Chrome to access Google services, such as Gmail, does not cause Google to receive any additional personally identifying information about you. On Google websites and other websites that opt in, if Chrome detects signs that you are being actively attacked by someone on the network (a "man in the middle attack"), Chrome may send information about that connection to Google or the website you visited to help determine the extent of the attack and how the attack functions. Google provides participating website owners with reports about attacks occurring on their sites.<p>
<p><b><u>Prerendering:</b><p></u>
 To load web pages faster, Chrome has a setting that can look up the IP addresses of links on a web page and open network connections. Sites and Android apps can also ask the browser to preload the pages you might visit next. Preloading requests from Android apps are controlled by the same setting as Chrome-initiated predictions. But preloading instructions from sites are always performed, regardless of whether Chrome’s network prediction feature is enabled. If prerendering is requested, whether by Chrome or by a site or app, the preloaded site is allowed to set and read its own cookies just as if you had visited it, even if you don’t end up visiting the prerendered page.<p>

<b><u>Location:<p></b></u>
<p>To get more geographically relevant information, Chrome gives you the option to share your location with a site. Chrome won't allow a site to access your location without your permission; however, on mobile devices, Chrome automatically shares your location with your default search engine if the Chrome app has permission to access your location and you haven’t blocked geolocation for the associated web site. Chrome uses Google Location Services to estimate your location.<p>

 <b><u>The information that Chrome sends to Google Location Services may include:<p></b></u>
<ul type="square">

<li>The Wi-Fi routers closest to you</li>
<li>Cell IDs of the cell towers closest to you</li>
<li>The strength of your Wi-Fi or cell signal</li>
<li>The IP address that is currently assigned to your device</li>
<li>Google doesn't have control over third-party websites or their privacy practices, so be cautious when sharing your location with a website.</li></ul><p>
<u><b><p>Updates:<p></b></u>
<p> Chrome periodically sends information to Google to check for updates, get connectivity status, validate the current time, and estimate the number of active users.<p>

Search features. If you are signed in to a Google site and Google is your default search engine, searches you perform using the address bar in Chrome are stored in your Google Account.

Search prediction service. To help you find information faster, Chrome uses the prediction service provided by your default search engine to offer likely completions to the text you are typing. When you search using the address bar in Chrome, the characters you type (even if you haven’t hit "enter" yet) are sent to your default search engine. If Google is your default search engine, predictions are based on your own search history, topics related to what you’re typing and what other people are searching for. Predictions can also based on your browsing history.<p>

Navigation assistance. When you can’t connect to a web page, you can get suggestions for alternative pages similar to the one you're trying to reach. In order to offer you suggestions, Chrome sends Google the URL of the page you're trying to reach.<p>

Autofill and password management. In order to improve Chrome’s Autofill and password management services, Chrome sends Google limited, anonymous information about the web forms that you encounter or submit while Autofill or password management is enabled, including a hashed URL of the web page and details of the form's structure.<p>

<b><u>Payments:<p></b></u>
<p> When you are signed into Chrome with your Google account, Chrome may offer to save payment cards and related billing information to your Google Payments account. Chrome may also offer you the option of filling payment cards from your Google Payments account into web forms. If you have cards saved locally in Chrome, Chrome may prompt you to save them to your Google Payments account. If you use a payment card from your Google Payments account or choose to save your payment card in your Google Payments account for future use, Chrome will collect information about your computer and share it with Google Pay to protect you from fraud and provide the service. If supported by the merchant, Chrome will also allow you to pay using Google Pay.<p>
