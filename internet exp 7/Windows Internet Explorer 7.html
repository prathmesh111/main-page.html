<h2>Windows Internet Explorer 7</h2>
<h3>Windows Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) (codenamed Rincon)[1] is a web browser for Windows.
 It was released by Microsoft in October 2006. Internet Explorer 7 is part of a long line 
of versions of Internet Explorer and was the first major update to the browser in more than 
5 years. It is the default browser in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 and can replace 
Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 but unlike version 6, this version
 does not support Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows 2000, and Windows ME.

Some portions of the underlying architecture, including the rendering engine and security 
framework, have been improved. New features include tabbed browsing, page zooming, an 
integrated search box, a feed reader, better internationalization, and improved support
 for web standards, although it does not pass the Acid2 or Acid3 tests. Security enhancements 
include a phishing filter, stronger encryption on Windows Vista (256-bit from 128-bit in XP),
 and a "Delete browsing history" button to easily clear private data. It is also the first 
version of Internet Explorer which is branded and marketed under the name 'Windows', instead 
of 'Microsoft'. IE7 shipped as the default browser in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008
 and was offered as a replacement for Internet Explorer 6 for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP.
\ IE7 was superseded by Internet Explorer 8 in March 2009.
