<h2>Phishing filter</h2>
<h3>Some users have criticised the phishing filter for being too easy to circumvent. 
One successful method of bypassing Internet Explorer's Phishing Filter has been reported
 by redirecting a blacklisted web page to another, non-blacklisted page, using a server-side redirect.
 Until the new page is blocked as well, the attack can remain active.

This flaw means that phishers can keep links from previous emails functioning by simply 
moving to a new server when their original web page is blacklisted and adding a redirect.


This has been criticised as doubly serious as the presence of a phishing filter may lull
 users into a false sense of security when the filter can be bypassed.

Phishing filter went on to be developed into and renamed Safety Filter and then SmartScreen 
by Microsoft, during the development of Internet Explorer 8
