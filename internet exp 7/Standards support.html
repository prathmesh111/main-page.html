<h2>Standards support</h2>


<h3>Internet Explorer 7 adds support for per-pixel alpha transparency in PNG,
 as well as minor improvements to HTML, CSS and DOM support. Microsoft's stated 
goal with version 7 was to fix the most significant bugs and areas which caused 
the most trouble for developers, however full compatibility with standards was
 postponed.

Internet Explorer 7 additionally features an update to the WinInet API. The new
 version has better support for IPv6, and handles hexadecimal literals in the IPv6
 address. It also includes better support for Gzip and deflate compression, so that 
communication with a web server can be compressed and thus will require less data
 to be transferred. Internet Explorer Protected Mode support in WinInet is
 exclusive to Windows Vista.

Although Internet Explorer 7 is more compliant than previous versions, according
 to all figures it remains the least standards-compliant compared to other major 
browsers of the period. It does not pass the Acid2 or the Acid3 tests, two test
 cases designed by the Web Standards Project to verify CSS compliance.

In a 2008 MSNBC article, Tim Berners-Lee said that lack of support in Internet 
Explorer was responsible for holding back the widespread adoption by webmasters 
of several new open technology standards, specifically scalable vector graphics 
(SVG), supported elsewhere since 2001, but only available in Internet Explorer
 using a 3rd party plugin (until the release of Internet Explorer 9).</h3>
