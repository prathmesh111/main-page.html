<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>With this version, Internet Explorer was renamed from Microsoft Internet Explorer to Windows 
Internet Explorer as part of Microsoft's rebranding of components that are included with Windows.

Internet Explorer 7 introduces the Windows RSS Platform with which it is tightly integrated and 
can subscribe to RSS and Atom feeds, synchronize and update them on a schedule and display them 
with its built-in style sheet.

Version 7 is intended to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software,
 and it also features full user control of ActiveX and better security framework, including not
 being integrated as much with Windows as previous versions, thereby increasing security.
 Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer ActiveX control is not hosted in the Windows
 Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements
 to its support for web standards, tabbed browsing with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine
 search box, a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and antiphishing filter.
 On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means 
that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the browser. 
The integrated search box supports OpenSearch.

On Windows Vista, Internet Explorer operates in a special "Protected Mode", that runs the browser in a 
security sandbox that has no WRITE access to the rest of the operating system or file system. When running
 in Protected Mode, IE7 is a low integrity process; it cannot gain write access to files and registry 
keys outside of the low-integrity portions of a user's profile. This feature aims to mitigate problems
 whereby newly discovered flaws in the browser (or in Add-Ons hosted inside it) allowed crackers to 
subversively install software on the user's computer (typically spyware).</h3>
