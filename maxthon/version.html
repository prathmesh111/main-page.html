<h1><b><u><center>version of Maxthon</center></u></b></h1>
<h2>Types Of Version</h2>

<h3>
<h2><font size="5">Version 1.x</h2></font>
Maxthon version 1, which continued version 0 of MyIE2, was an Internet Explorer shell that implemented a 
tabbed browser using the Trident web browser engine which Microsoft introduced with Internet Explorer 4. As such,
 version 1 was compatible with every version of Windows from Windows 95 to Windows 7.
 Development of version 1 stopped in 2010 with the so-called Maxthon (Classic), version 1.6.7.35;[54] earlier releases are available from Maxthon,[55] and version 1.6.7.35, which fixed a bug in selecting the default search engine, is still available at other download sites.[56][57]
There are many add-ons available for Maxthon Classic,[58] and more are available through discussion forums.
Specific threads may provide direct download links also.[60] Some add-ons are build-specific, but in that case, 
a clear indication of compatibility can often be found.
Maxthon 1.3.1 brought cloud-based service for online syncing bookmarks (favorites) in 2005

Maxthon Browser 2 is a multi-tab browser released in July 2007.[46] A later modification in 2008 was the first
