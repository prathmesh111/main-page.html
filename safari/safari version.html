<h1><b><u>Version</u></b></h1>



<h3>
<h2>Safari 1</h2>

On January 7, 2003, at Macworld San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had developed its own web browser, called Safari.
 It was based on Apple's internal fork of the KHTML rendering engine, called WebKit.The company released the first beta version, 
available only for Mac OS X, later that day. A number of official and unofficial beta versions followed, up until version 1.0 was released
 on June 23, 2003. Initially only available as a separate download for Mac OS X 10.2, Safari was bundled with Mac OS X v10.3 on 
October 24, 2003 as the default browser, with Internet Explorer for Mac included only as an alternative browser. Version 1.0.3, 
released on August 13, 2004 was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.2, while 1.3.2, released on January 12, 2006 was the last version
 to support Mac OS X 10.3. However, 10.3 received security updates through 2007.


<h2>Safari 2</h2>

In April 2005, Dave Hyatt, one of the Safari developers at Apple, documented his study by fixing specific bugs in Safari, 
thereby enabling it to pass the Acid2 test developed by the Web Standards Project. On April 27, 2005, he announced that 
his development version of Safari now passed the test, making it the first web browser to do so.
Safari 2.0 was released on April 29, 2005, as the only web browser included with Mac OS X 10.4. This version was touted
 by Apple as possessing a 1.8x speed boost over version 1.2.4, but did not yet include the Acid2 bug fixes. The necessary
 changes were initially unavailable to end-users unless they downloaded and compiled the WebKit source code themselves 
or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at OpenDarwin.org.Apple eventually released version 2.0.2 of Safari
, which included the modifications required to pass Acid2, on October 31, 2005.
In June 2005, after some criticism from KHTML developers over lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development 
source code and bug tracking of WebCore and JavaScriptCore to OpenDarwin.org. WebKit itself was also released as open source.
 The source code for non-renderer aspects of the browser, such as its GUI elements, remains proprietary.
The final stable version of Safari 2, Safari 2.0.4, was released on January 10, 2006 for Mac OS X. It was only available as part of Mac 
OS X Update 10.4.4. This version addressed layout and CPU usage issues, among other improvements.Safari 2.0.4 was the last
 version to be released exclusively on Mac OS X until version 6 in 2012.

<h2>Safari 3</h2>

On January 9, 2007, at Macworld SF, Jobs announced the iPhone. The device’s operating system (later called iPhone OS and subsequently renamed to iOS) 
used a mobile version of the Safari browser and was able to display full, desktop-class websites.
On June 11, 2007, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Jobs announced Safari 3 for Mac OS X 10.5, Windows XP, and Windows Vista
. During the announcement, he ran a benchmark based on the iBench browser test suite comparing the most popular Windows browsers, hence
 claiming that Safari was the fastest browser. Later third-party tests of HTTP load times would support Apple's claim that Safari 3 was indeed the
 fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was found to be only negligibly faster than
 Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla Firefox when loading static content from local cache.
The initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, had several known bugs and a zero
 day exploit that allowed remote execution.The addressed bugs were then corrected by Apple three days later on June 14, 2007, in version
 3.0.1 for Windows. On June 22, 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance issues and other security issues. Safari 3.0.2
 for Windows handles some fonts that are missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers, such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others.
The iPhone was formally released on June 29, 2007. It included a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version, 
but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device. The version number of Safari as reported in its user agent string is 3.0, in line with
 the contemporary desktop versions of Safari.
The first stable, non-beta release of Safari for Windows, Safari 3.1, was offered as a free download on March 18, 2008. In June 2008,
 Apple released version 3.1.2,addressing a security vulnerability in the Windows version where visiting a malicious web site could
 force a download of executable files and execute them on the user's desktop.
Safari 3.2, released on November 13, 2008, introduced anti-phishing features using Google Safe Browsing and Extended Validation Certificate support. 
The final version of Safari 3 is 3.2.3, released on May 12, 2009.


<h2>Safari 4</h2>

On June 2, 2008, the WebKit development team announced SquirrelFish, a new JavaScript engine that vastly improves Safari's speed 
at interpreting scripts. The engine is one of the new features in Safari 4, released to developers on June 11, 2008. The new JavaScript
 engine quickly evolved into SquirrelFish Extreme, featuring even further improved performance over SquirrelFish, and was eventually 
marketed as Nitro. A public beta of Safari 4 was released on February 24, 2009, with new features such as the Top Sites tool 
(similar to Opera's Speed Dial feature), which displays the user's most visited sites on a 3D wall. Cover Flow, a feature of Mac OS X and
 iTunes, was also implemented in Safari. In the public beta versions, tabs were placed in the title bar of the window, similar to Google Chrome.
 The tab bar was moved back to its original location, below the URL bar, in the final release. The Windows version adopted a native
 Windows theme, rather than the previously employed Mac OS X-style interface. Also Apple removed the blue progress bar located in the 
address bar (later reinstated in Safari 5). Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on June 17, 2009 and fixed problems with Faces in iPhoto '09. 
Safari 4 in Mac OS X v10.6 "Snow Leopard" has 64-bit support, which can make JavaScript loading up to 50% faster. It also has built-in crash
 resistance unique to Snow Leopard; crash resistance will keep the browser intact if a plug-in like Flash player crashes, such that the other
 tabs or windows will be unaffected. Safari 4.0.4, released on November 11, 2009 for both OS X and Windows, further improves JavaScript
 performance.
Safari was one of the twelve browsers offered to EU users of Microsoft Windows in 2010. It was one of the five browsers displayed on the 
first page of browser choices along with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera.
Safari 4 features
Beginning with Safari 4, the address bar has been completely revamped:
    The blue inline progress bar is replaced with a spinning bezel and a loading indicator attached to it.
    The button to add a bookmark is now attached to the address bar by default.
    The reload/stop button is now superimposed on the right end of the address bar.
Safari on Mac OS X and Windows was made to look more similar to Safari on iPhone than previous versions.
Safari 4 also includes the following new features:
    Completely passes the Acid3 standards test
    Cover Flow browsing for History and Bookmarks
    Improved developer tools, including Web Inspector, CSS element viewing, JavaScript debugger and profiler, offline table and database management with SQL
 support, and resource graphs
    Nitro JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript up to eight times faster than Internet Explorer 8 and more than four times faster than Firefox 3
    Native Windows look on Windows (Aero, Luna, Classic, etc., depending on OS and settings) with standard Windows font rendering and optional Apple font rendering
    Support for CSS image retouching effects
    Support for CSS Canvas
    Speculative loading, where Safari loads the documents, scripts, and style information that are required to view a web page ahead of time
    Support for HTML5
    Top Sites, which displays up to 24 thumbnails of a user's most frequently visited pages on startup


<h2>Safari 5</h2>
Apple released Safari 5 on June 7, 2010, featuring the new Safari Reader for reading articles on the web without distraction (based on Arc90's
 Readability tool, and a 30 percent JavaScript performance increase over Safari 4. Safari 5 includes improved developer tools and supports
 more than a dozen new HTML5 technologies, focused on interoperability. With Safari 5, developers can now create secure Safari Extensions to
 customize and enhance the browsing experience.[34] Apple also re-added the progress bar behind the address bar in this release. Safari 5.0.1
 enabled the Extensions PrefPane by default; previously, users had to enable it via the Debug menu.
Apple also released Safari 4.1 concurrently with Safari 5, exclusively for Mac OS X Tiger. The update included the majority of the features and
 security enhancements found in Safari 5. It did not, however, include Safari Reader or Safari Extensions. Together with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 
Apple released Safari 5.1 for both Windows and Mac on July 20, 2011, with the new function 'Reading List' and a faster browsing experience.
 Apple simultaneously released Safari 5.0.6 for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, excluding Leopard users from the new functions in Safari 5.1.
Safari 5.1.7 has become the last version of Safari developed for Windows.

with the release of OS X Mountain Lion on July 25, 2012, and is integrated into the OS. As Apple integrated it with Mountain Lion, it 
is no longer available for download from the Apple website or other sources. Apple released Safari 6 via Software Update for users of O

Apple has stated "Safari 6 is available for Mountain Lion and Lion. Safari 5 continues to be available for Windows." Microsoft removed 
Safari from its BrowserChoice page.
On June 11, 2012, Apple released a developer preview of Safari 6.0 with a feature called iCloud Tabs, which allows users to 'sync' their
 open tabs with any iOS or other OS X device running the latest software. Safari 6 also included new privacy features, including an "Ask
